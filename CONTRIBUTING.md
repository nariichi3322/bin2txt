- It's hard to understand the Component's history. We might repeat errors already fixed.
- There are unnecessary commits which pollute logs and make history hard to read. Also, functionalities like git blame become irrelevant.
- It seems that a feature was added by a few commits. Which commit should I include if I want to revert this operation?
